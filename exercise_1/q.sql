-- create a user "user_444" with password '123'
-- create a database "db_1"
-- input all the tables into your database (by creating another .sql file)

-- now, write queries for the following (you can take help from internet):
-- 1) a) find all branches that have more than 700000000 assets.
--    b) find all branches in Mumbai that have assets between (inclusive) 800000000 and 600000000.
--    c) find all cities (no repetations allowed).

-- 2) find the branches that have the highest assets. also, delete all such branches from the table.

-- 3) find the total, count and average assets of all banks in 'Chennai' (all three values (total, count & avg) must be in a single table).

-- 4) find the cities of all 'State Bank of India' and 'Bank of India'.

-- 5) find all the branches that are located in any city other than 'Chennai' and 'Mumbai'.

-- 6) a) find all the branches that have more assets than any branch in 'Delhi'.
--    b) find all the branches that have less assets than any branch in 'Delhi'.
--    c) find all the branches that have assets between (inclusive) any two branches in 'Chennai'.
--    d) find all the branches in 'Mumbai' that have more assets than the average assets of all branches in 'Delhi', 'Chennai', 'Kochi', 'Gurugram', 'Srinagar', 'Nainital', 'Kolkata'.

-- 7) for this question, consider that branches are rated by their assets
--    find all the branches in 'Chennai' that have more assets than bottom 5 branches in 'Mumbai' (if 'Mumbai' has less than 6 branches, then consider all those branches).

-- 8) a) find all cities that have at only one branch.
--    b) find all cities that have at least two branches.
--    c) find all cities that have at least three branches.
